## 💡 Talking Points (Use These Anywhere)

### The 30-Second Pitch
> "Work Timer is a free, no-signup time tracker that lets users see their work patterns visually and export data as CSV. Built with modular architecture ready to scale. Phase 1 is done, Phase 2 (charts + alerts) in 2 weeks."

### The Problem Statement
> "Existing time trackers cost $10-50/month, require signup, and don't export easily. Freelancers and remote workers want simple, free, private tracking."

### The Differentiation
> "We're not competing on features. We're winning on simplicity, price, and privacy. And we move fast—Phase 2 in 2 weeks."

### The Business Model
> "Free now to build user base. Premium features for power users in Phase 2. Team features for B2B in Phase 3. Multiple revenue streams."

### The Timeline
> "Phase 1 (done): MVP. Phase 2 (2 weeks): Notifications + charts. Phase 3: Analytics + integrations. Phase 4: Team features."
