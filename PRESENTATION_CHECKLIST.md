### Decision Path

**If GO Approved:**

- [ ] Update roadmap on GitHub
- [ ] Begin development

**If Conditional (feedback needed):**
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting
- [ ] Address specific concerns
- [ ] Propose timeline for decision

**If NO (not approved):**
- [ ] Ask specific reasons
- [ ] Propose alternatives
- [ ] Understand what's needed to pivot

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know the presentation worked if:

- [ ] Stakeholders ask detailed questions
- [ ] They request follow-up docs
- [ ] They want to see Phase 2 timeline
- [ ] They ask about team/budget
- [ ] They demo the app themselves
- [ ] They mention it to others

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Silent, no questions (confusion)
- ❌ Questions about market size (hadn't researched)
- ❌ Focus only on cost (not value)
- ❌ Asking if competitors are better (lost them)

## 🎤 Demo Script Quick Reference

### Copy-Paste if You Need Backup

```
Timer: "Click Start to begin tracking. Click Stop to save. That's it."

Calendar: "Each day shows hours worked with color intensity. Darker = more work."

Export: "One click downloads a CSV file they can use anywhere."

Dark mode: "User preference saved. Next time they visit, it remembers."

Architecture: "We refactored monolithic code into 8 focused modules. Easier to test, extend, maintain."

Phase 2: "Notifications, charts, analytics. Two-week timeline."

Business: "Free now to build users. Premium features later."
```

## 🚀 Last-Minute Tips

### If Demo Breaks
> "No worries, I have a screenshot version. But let me try that again real quick..."
> 
> Use backup screenshot instead of panicking

### If Stakeholder Asks Hard Question
> "That's a great question. I want to give you the right answer. Let me follow up with data on that."
> 
> Don't make up numbers

### If Running Over Time
> "We could go deeper on Phase 2, but I want to respect your time. Happy to send detailed docs and sync next week."
> 
> End strong, not rushed

### If Feeling Nervous
> "I built something I'm proud of. These people are smart. They'll get it. Breathe. You've got this."
