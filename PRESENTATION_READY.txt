                        TALKING POINTS (Memorize These)

30-Second Pitch:
"Work Timer is a free, no-signup time tracker. Users can track sessions,
see patterns in a calendar, and export as CSV. Built with modular
architecture ready to scale. Phase 1 done, Phase 2 ships in 2 weeks."

The Problem:
"Existing tools cost $10-50/month, require signup, and don't export easily.
Freelancers and remote workers want simple, free, private tracking."

The Solution:
"Click. Track. Analyze. Export. No signup, no cost, all data stays local."

The Differentiation:
"We win on simplicity, price, and privacy. Fast iteration. Phase 2 in 2 weeks."

The Timeline:
"Phase 1 (done): MVP. Phase 2 (2 weeks): Notifications + charts.
Phase 3 (month 2): Analytics. Phase 4 (month 3): Team features."

The Ask:
"We need your approval to start Phase 2 and budget for 2 engineers for 6 weeks."
